# unbreak — this script runs when a Focus session unbreaks
#
# The text here is a special kind of text called BASH script.
# This is a programming language that lets you run special commands
# when a Focus session unbreaks, like adding functionality that doesn't
# exist yet—or integrating with other applications.
#
# Hint: Lines that start with '#' are comments, and are ignored.
#
# Hint: Remove the leading '#' below to run some of the examples.
#
# Example 1: A voice will say "Focus is starting". Edit this to be whatever you want!
# say "Focus is starting"
#
# Example 2: Play a custom sound (view /System/Library/Sounds for a full list or provide your own)
# afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Funk.aiff
#
# Example 3: Show a custom notification
# osascript -e 'display notification "Get to work!" with title "Focusing"'
#
# This just scratches the surface of what's possible with scripting. You can
# also integrate with other applications, like Slack and enable things like
# Do Not Disturb mode on your Mac.
